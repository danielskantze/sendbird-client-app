- Animate scrolling when loading more
- Message when no more messages to load
- Filler message when no messages loaded
## Understand better

- What is best practice for working with application configuration, content and pure view states? If everything is handled the same way it feels like we mix concerns. But still I can think of nothing that says we cannot handle it using the same Redux pattern. Rather we would just manage serialisation and persistence depending on what type of state it is. 
- Understand normalised state better
- Consider how the state management could be done without redux
